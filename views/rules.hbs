<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who we are</h2>
<p>Our website address is: http://paradise.gta3.pl.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What personal data we collect and why we collect it</h2>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Media</h3>
<p>If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cookies</h3>
<p>If you leave a comment on our site you may opt in to saving your name in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.</p>
<p>When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select "Remember Me", your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Embedded content from other websites</h3>
<p>Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.</p>
<p>These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How long we retain your data</h2>
<p>If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognise and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.</p>
<p>For users that register on our server (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Where we send your data</h2>
<p>Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.</p>
